# Pith API

The server-side portion of Pith. Implemented in Python using Flask and socket.io with [Flask-SocketIO](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO).

## Development

We use MongoDB as the database for Pith. Install it locally on your machine following [MongoDB's instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```
python app.py
```
