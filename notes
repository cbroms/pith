Need to think about what is the "base" thing that is being manipulated.
The mongo entries or the abstract objects.  
=> This determines if we use a struct/method model or an object model.
Furthermore, should database methods pertaining to an entity be within the
entity's model/feature file?

After this, make sure all the calls/objects used are correct.
